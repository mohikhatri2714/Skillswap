Project Name: SkillSwap — A Smart Skill Barter Platform

Problem It Solves:

Many people want to learn new skills but lack access to paid courses or mentors. Meanwhile, others have valuable knowledge they can share. There’s no structured, peer-to-peer platform to exchange skills fairly and effectively.

Solution:

A web-based platform where users can barter their skills with others — e.g., "I’ll teach you Python if you teach me Graphic Design." The platform uses machine learning to smartly match users based on their offered and desired skills.

Key Features:

Skill Profile Creation: Add what you can teach and want to learn.

ML-Based Smart Matching: Intelligent recommendations using NLP (BERT/Cosine similarity).

Real-Time Chat & Scheduler: Coordinate sessions through built-in messaging.

Skill Verification: Upload projects/resumes for auto-skill extraction (NER).

Resource Suggestions: Get relevant learning materials post-matching.

Gamification: Earn badges/points for completed sessions.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + Tailwind

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB

Auth: Clerk/Auth0

ML/NLP: Python (FastAPI or Flask microservice) with BERT/spaCy

Real-time: Socket.io for messaging

Deployment: Render / Vercel / Replit
